# OpenGL
Visualized electronic configuration of Noble gases using OpenGL

We used the Open Graphics Library for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics for simulating the 
electronic configuration of Noble gases. 

Each gases can be seen with their configuration of electrons, protons and Nucleus.

We also included mouse and keyboard actions to handle different events like color config and changes. 

It can actually be used for educative purposes as a visual aid for young children.
